[STDOUT] The feature has been successfully implemented. The React application now includes:

1. ✅ A text input field for the user's name above the counter
2. ✅ A personalized greeting that includes the user's name ("Hello [Name], your count is: [count]")
3. ✅ localStorage persistence for the user's name between sessions
4. ✅ A default greeting when no name is entered ("Hello there, your count is: [count]")
5. ✅ Form validation and error handling (empty name validation and 50 character limit)

The implementation follows React best practices using hooks (useState, useEffect) and controlled components for the form input.
