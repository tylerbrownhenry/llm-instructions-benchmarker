[STDOUT] I've successfully implemented the user name input feature for the React counter application. The implementation includes:

1. **Name input field** with proper labeling and accessibility attributes
2. **Personalized greeting** that displays "Hello [Name], your count is: [count]" or "Hello there, your count is: [count]" when no name is entered
3. **localStorage persistence** to save and restore the user's name between sessions
4. **Comprehensive validation** that:
   - Limits names to 50 characters
   - Only allows letters, spaces, hyphens, and apostrophes
   - Shows clear error messages for invalid input
5. **Styled components** with proper CSS for the input field and error messages

The code follows React best practices with:
- Functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Named constants instead of magic numbers
- Proper error handling and validation
- Accessibility features (labels, ARIA attributes)
- Clean separation of concerns
