[STDOUT] All tests are passing! I've successfully implemented the user name input feature following TDD principles:

1. ✅ Added a text input field for the user's name above the counter
2. ✅ Display a personalized greeting that includes the user's name 
3. ✅ Save the user's name to localStorage so it persists between sessions
4. ✅ Show a default greeting when no name is entered
5. ✅ Include proper form validation and error handling for the name input

The implementation includes:
- Name validation (empty check, max length of 50 characters)
- Whitespace trimming
- Error messages that appear on blur
- Persistence to localStorage
- Loading saved name on mount

All functionality was developed test-first following the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.
