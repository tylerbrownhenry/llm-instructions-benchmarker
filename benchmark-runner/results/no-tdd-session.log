[STDOUT] I've successfully implemented the user name input feature with the following additions:

1. **Name Input Field**: Added a text input above the counter with a "Set Name" button
2. **Personalized Greeting**: Displays "Hello [Name], your count is: [count]" when a name is set, or "Hello there, your count is: [count]" as default
3. **LocalStorage Persistence**: The name is saved to localStorage and loaded on app initialization
4. **Form Validation**: 
   - Validates that the name is not empty (trimmed)
   - Limits name length to 50 characters
   - Shows error messages for invalid input
   - Clears errors when user starts typing again
5. **Styling**: Added professional styling that matches the existing dark theme with the teal accent color

The implementation follows React best practices using hooks (useState, useEffect) and maintains the existing project patterns.
