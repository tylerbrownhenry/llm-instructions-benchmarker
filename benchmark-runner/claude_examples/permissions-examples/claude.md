# Full Permissions Configuration

This project grants Claude Code comprehensive permissions to automate development workflows without constant approval prompts.

## Permission Categories

### Tool Permissions
- **Bash**: Full command execution with system modification rights
- **File Operations**: Complete read/write/delete/execute access
- **Network**: Web fetching, API calls, and downloads enabled
- **Git**: All git operations including commit, push, branch, merge
- **Package Management**: Install, update, and global package operations

### Auto-Approval Rules

#### File Operations
Automatically approved file types:
- JavaScript/TypeScript: `*.js`, `*.ts`, `*.jsx`, `*.tsx`
- Configuration: `*.json`
- Documentation: `*.md`

#### Bash Commands
Pre-approved commands:
- `npm install`, `npm run *`
- `yarn install`, `pnpm install`
- `git add .`, `git commit -m *`

#### Git Operations
- `add`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`
- `checkout`, `merge`, `branch`

## Safety Features

### Backup Protection
- Automatic backups before file deletion
- Operation logging for audit trail
- Destructive operations bypass confirmation (use with caution)

## Use Cases

### Rapid Development
```bash
# Claude can automatically:
claude "Install React Router and set up routing"
# - Runs npm install react-router-dom
# - Creates route configuration
# - Updates components
# - Commits changes
```

### CI/CD Integration
```bash
# Automated deployment pipeline:
claude "Run tests, build, and deploy to staging"
# - Executes test suite
# - Builds production bundle
# - Deploys to staging environment
# - Updates deployment logs
```

### Code Maintenance
```bash
# Bulk updates and refactoring:
claude "Update all components to use new API endpoints"
# - Searches and replaces API calls
# - Updates type definitions
# - Runs tests to verify changes
# - Commits with descriptive messages
```

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important**: This configuration grants extensive permissions. Use only in:
- Development environments
- Trusted projects
- Controlled CI/CD pipelines

### Best Practices
1. Regularly review operation logs
2. Use version control for all changes
3. Test in isolated environments first
4. Monitor for unexpected behavior

## Monitoring

### Activity Logs
- All operations logged to `.claude/operations.log`
- Git history provides change tracking
- Package.json changes tracked

### Review Points
- Weekly permission audit
- Monthly security review
- Immediate investigation of anomalies

## Example Workflows

### Full-Stack Feature Development
1. Create feature branch
2. Implement frontend components
3. Build backend endpoints
4. Write comprehensive tests
5. Update documentation
6. Deploy to staging
7. Merge to main branch

All steps automated with single command:
```bash
claude "Implement user authentication feature with OAuth"
```
