## Quick Start

1. **Choose a configuration**: Browse the example folders
2. **Copy settings**: Use `.claude` and `claude.md` files as templates
3. **Customize**: Adapt settings to your project needs
4. **Test**: Validate configuration with simple tasks

## Common Patterns

### Basic Automation
```json
{
  "automation": {
    "auto_format": true,
    "auto_lint": true,
    "auto_test": false
  }
}
```

### Hook-Based Quality
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "post-edit": [
      {"name": "format", "command": "prettier --write {file}"},
      {"name": "test", "command": "npm test -- {file}"}
    ]
  }
}
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination
```json
{
  "agents": [
    {"name": "frontend", "tools": ["React", "TypeScript"]},
    {"name": "backend", "tools": ["Node", "Express"]},
    {"name": "testing", "tools": ["Jest", "Cypress"]}
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic automation, add complexity gradually
- **Test Thoroughly**: Validate settings in development environments first
- **Document Changes**: Use `claude.md` to explain project-specific configurations
- **Version Control**: Track configuration changes alongside code
- **Security First**: Review permission grants and auto-approval rules

## Configuration Files

- **`.claude`**: JSON configuration for settings, hooks, agents, and permissions
- **`claude.md`**: Documentation explaining project context and usage
- **Templates**: Reusable file templates for components, tests, and documentation
