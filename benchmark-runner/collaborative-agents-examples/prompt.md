Deploy your collaborative agent team to add a comprehensive user profile feature to this React application. The team should work together to:

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Have the requirements analyst define user stories for a profile system

5. **Integration Testing**: Verify all components work together seamlessly

The feature should include:
- User profile with name, email, bio, and avatar URL
