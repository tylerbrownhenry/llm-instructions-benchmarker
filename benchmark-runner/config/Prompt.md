# Benchmark Test Prompt

Add a new feature to this React application: implement a user name input that personalizes the counter display. The feature should:

1. Add a text input field for the user's name above the counter
2. Display a personalized greeting that includes the user's name (e.g., "Hello [Name], your count is: [count]")
3. Save the user's name to localStorage so it persists between sessions
4. Show a default greeting when no name is entered (e.g., "Hello there, your count is: [count]")
5. Include proper form validation and error handling for the name input

Please implement this feature following the project's existing patterns and your configured guidelines.
